       <p> Hi my name is Samy El-Jisri. I have lived and worked in the Greater Toronto Area for my entire career. I've been working at TD Bank for the past 3+ years and I'm currently working as a Senior BI and Reporting Analyst. My role has me splitting my duties between daily reporting tasks and working on projects to improve our reporting capabilities within the department. I am looking forward to continuing my development both from expanding my knowledge of the bank and also my technical capaiblities.</p>
       <p> Outside of work, I have a variety of hobbies. One of my hobbies is playing recreational softball and I've been playing for the past 6 years. Typically play first or third base and I would consider myself to be an above average hitter that hits for a combination of power and average. Last year, I had the misfortune of tearing my achilles tendon and was forced to sit out the second half of the season. I hope to be back into normal form and injury free for the upcoming summer season.</p>
       <p> My other favourite hobbies that I've been able to take up for the last 3 years is to travel and watch live events. I've been able to travel to Europe 4 times in the past three years. Some of my highlights have been to see about 15 different soccer (or football if you're in Europe) games during my trips. You'll notice my profile picture is with me wearing an Ajax Amsterdam jersey just before watching their match. I've seen Arsenal, Bayern Munich (twice at home), Borrusia Dortmund, Real Madrid (twice at home), Barcelona, Ajax, Feyenoord, Chelsea, Manchester City, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen, FC Basel and FC Copenhagen. Some of the other events I've been able to see have been the 2017 French Open (tennis), Depeche Mode in Copenhagen, Above and Beyond in Hamburg, Tiesto in Gothenburg and while at the Amsterdam Dance Event/Festival: Martin Garrix, Don Diablo, Hardwell, Marshmello, Yellow Claw, Armin Van Buuren and David Guetta.</p>
